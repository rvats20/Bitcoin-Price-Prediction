## Introduction

Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that has gained significant popularity over the years. Predicting its price can be challenging due to its volatility. This project leverages historical data and machine learning algorithms to forecast Bitcoin prices.

## Features

- Data collection from various sources
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Implementation of multiple machine learning models
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Visualization of predictions

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bitcoin-price-prediction.git
cd bitcoin-price-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Data Collection**: Run the script to collect and preprocess data.
   ```bash
   python data_collection.py
   ```

2. **Training Models**: Train the machine learning models.
   ```bash
   python train_models.py
   ```

3. **Making Predictions**: Use the trained models to make predictions.
   ```bash
   python predict.py
   ```

## Models

The following models are implemented in this project:

- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
- ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)

## Results

The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Visualizations of the predictions are provided to compare the models.
